#### Hardware
When designing the hardware, cost will be a key consideration. Initially, hardware will be created through 3D printing and simple woodworking. Designing the hardware will be done using various design applications such as FreeCAD, Fusion360, and Blender. For electronic hardware development and wiring, the final design will be created via a PCB manufacturer.

#### Real-Time Updates
Through the mobile app, the FollowBot will provide real-time updates on battery life, distance between the user and the FollowBot, the temperature within the FollowBot's capsule, and the weight distribution on the FollowBot. Notifications will be sent to the user if the battery life is low or if the FollowBot needs help or repair.

#### Machine Learning Models
We aim to add machine learning to the FollowBot. The capability for the FollowBot to learn from its mistakes through reinforcement learning could be beneficial in improving performance while conserving battery life. Our goal is to maximize battery life so the FollowBot can be used daily without frequent charging. As well as finding best possible paths to better improve the following mechanics of FollowBot.

#### Authentication/Security
We plan to add an authentication process when initializing the FollowBot on the user's account through the mobile app and the website. Each FollowBot will have a unique secure number configuration that cannot be changed. This configuration will only need to be done once.

#### Cost
We aim to keep the price range for the FollowBot under $500, ideally under $300. The device should be stable, useful, and beneficial to the consumer. The cost should attract consumers to buy our product. Our goal is to ensure the device is worth their money and to exceed their expectations.

<h2> 3.3 Design Rationale </h2>
We chose this architecture because we needed something modulus in order to do things properly for the scope of our project. When it comes to the authentication process it was tedious in knowing how we would come about it, but we knew that if we made it modular it would make it less tedious in our side. The way we did it is by creating a Database that the authenticator would interact with in order to generate keys for the FollowBot that would not create replicas based on the ones that are currently on the database. That was one rationale that we chose for this project. 
<br><br>
Another is by keeping the ros2 system on the raspberry pi very interactive between many different pieces of hardware and software. With the ROS2 most of the functionalities that will be introduced will always have to be modulus in order for us to communicate between many different areas of hardware and software. Although we've been consistently using a Microcontroller so switching between the two will depend based on how much modular this project will become. No doubt it will become more modular based on the number of components we will be adding.
<br><br>
We also need to rely on the learning models and the mapping api's in order to see the improvements in following within FollowBot. We will also need to getting the Mapping algorithm working accordingly with the FollowBot  which is keeping an eye on it's surroundings.
<br><br>
The way we structured our decomposition above makes it easier for us to understand how we will simplify yet comprehend how our system should be.

    
<h2> 4.0 Data Design </h2>

<h3> 4.1 Data Description </h3>
When it comes to data and obtaining historical data for the machine learning model we will be using dataframes in order to store the data properly, ranging from battery life to weight distribution. When it comes to Databases the information will also be stored in a table of data. Other forms of data storing will be used in other applications when it comes to the FollowBot itself

<h2> 6. Human Interface Design </h2>

<h3> Mobile App: </h3>
As a user when it comes to both the mobile application, it will contain most of the major functionalities. For instance with the mobile app you will be able to see how much battery life is currently on the system, as well as how much weight, the current distance it is away from you, as well as the interior temperature. With the mobile app you will be able to as well interact with the device by controlling its movement if needed. You will be able to test given features with it. Look at the specs of the FollowBot, as well as look at the health of the FollowBot. Parts and services will also be shown of the application itself. The app will be able to as well send you notifications based on how much health is currently on the system, whether if the FollowBot ran into some issues, or is in need of assistance. You as a user will be able to use the app throughout many different mobile devices ranging from apple to android. 
<br><br>

#### Important Functionalities 
Visually on the top right corner of the screen will indicate the battery life of your FollowBot. The middle of the screen will consist of a 3d model version of the FollowBot, while beneath the FollowBot will indicate the amount of weight that is currently on the system. In the middle above the FollowBot will indicate the current temperature within the interior of the FollowBot. A small tab button on the bottom right corner will allow the user to see how far away the FollowBot is from the user. 
<br><br>

#### Settings
on the top left corner will be a setting icon for the FollowBot, where you will be able to find the specs of the FollowBot, changing capabilities for when you want to change the distance between you and the FollowBot, as well as the ability to switch on human control access towards the FollowBot. When switching on human access within the mobile app, the ui will change to a control panel where you will now be able to control the FollowBot through touch screen.

#### Authentication
When accessing the app it will first bring you to an authenticator screen, where you will need to input your username or password . If the user is signing in for the first time then they'll also need to input the FollowBots authentication key in order to access their specific FollowBot that they purchased, as well as their email. However once they do it the first time they won't need to do it again. As a user you will be able to change your password, or username if you forgot. In order to do so, an email will be sent to the user in which they will have to confirm or not that they want a change for a new username or password.


### Website: 
As for the website, it will have minor interactions with the user. But for the user, the website will offer another variety of options that is quite different compared to the mobile app. For instance, the web interface will consist of a variety of tabs to open and see. One tab will consist of a feedback page/guide where you as the user that is currently an owner of the device will be able to ask questions or discuss topics based on the robotic device that you have on hand. Questions can vary from hardware parts, to ways in keeping the FollowBot clean, updating its software, or even future changes in parts for the FollowBot. 
<br><br>

#### Relevant tabs for user to go about
Other tabs will consists of information of the FollowBot, as well as a video recording in how the FollowBot interacts with it's surroundings. Another tab will be accessible to owners of the FollowBot where they will be able to interact with their FollowBot and see how well it's able to avoid obstacles while being able to follow a coordinated path. You will be able to control the FollowBot with this minor interaction that will be found on the web page.
<br><br>

#### News Posting
Another important feature that we would like to add is a news posting tab,
where people will be able to get notified in future updates based on the FollowBots development progress, or even updates on future releases for the FollowBot itself, such as enhancements in parts or software.

#### Authentication
As mentioned within the Mobile App user interface, it will be the same. However the difference will be that you don't have to sign in immediately, The webpage is meant for informational purposes. If you wish to create an account or sign in. A user profile icon for that will be found above in the right hand corner of your screen.

#### Mapping
ON the Mobile app there will be a mapping interface where you will be able to obtain the location of the FollowBot and pinpoint it to a new location. Either to you or to a point of interest. It will give you the estimated time for it to travel there.
