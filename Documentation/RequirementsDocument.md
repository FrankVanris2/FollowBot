# Requirements Documentation:

<h2> phase 1 </h2>

Specified Goal: Create a prototype that will follow an individual via bluetooth connection

__1. Aquire and upload ROS2 onto a Raspberry pi/Website production:__   
a. Flashing an sd card with UBUNTU OS  
b. Using documentation and instructions within the ROS2 site: https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/How-To-Guides/Installing-on-Raspberry-Pi.html to install ROS2  
c. Conducting ssh practices in order to code from a seperate device to the Raspberry PI.  
d. Produce and design the website for finalization for our product.

__2. Creating scripts based on specific parameters and tasks the Followbot will conduct/Website finalization:__    
a. C++ scripts to conduct movement and locative tasks.  
b. Constructing an application within a mobile device to instruct the user what the Followbot is currently doing.  
c. Include a form of networking between both devices.  
d. Finalize and tweak the website to our specifications.

__3. Creating a Machine Learning algorithm in order for the robot to avoid obstacles and pathfind through obstacles.__
a. C++ and Python scripts in order to conduct distancing between the user and the robot.
b. Using lidar sensors, and other sensors to detect objects.
c. Using computer vision in order to detect the user and follow the user.
d. Using encoders to calculate the movement in the wheels.

__3. Construct the design of the Followbot and build the Followbot:__  
a. Use fusion360 to create the design of the Followbot or CAD as another platform to use.  
b. obtaining the specified hardware and parts that is needed to construct the first prototype.  
c. finalize the design of the prototype.  

<h2> phase 2 </h2>    
Specified Goal: Improve the design of the prototye so that it can achieve avoidance and pathfinding through obstacles, and weight distributing tasks. Along with better power usage and a better user friendly interface within mobile devices. (This to be changed when we get closer to phase 2)
