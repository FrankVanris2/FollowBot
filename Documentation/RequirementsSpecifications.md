**In Reality:**<br>
This device will be able to map to specific locations that will give more accessibility to users that need assistance when carrying their belongings or when having an item transported to them. This Followbot is versatile and can be used by any individual, regardless of their current activity. Whether it's for work-related tasks, family outings, or simply to carry personal belongings, this Followbot is designed to meet the individual's needs. <br><br>

**2.3 Design and Implementation Constraints**<br>

The construction of the Followbot presents a significant challenge, given the intricate engineering required to create a device capable of carrying and autonomously following a user. The hardware components and their assembly will demand meticulous attention and precision.

On the software side we are utilizing the Arduino Uno Rev4 in order to send and do important tasks for the user. We will be developing a webpage and a app with valuabe information for the user to use when needed. Mapping capabilities and path-finding algorithms will be applied to the Followbot in order to avoid obstacles while following a designated path to a specific location. Computer vision techniques will be used to allow the Followbot to follow the user if needed in order for it to carry their belongings. Sensors such as Lidar, RGB etc. will come with software that will allow us to really improve the machine learning models that we will apply.

In terms of project success, our primary focus will be on systematic organization and incremental prototyping. We plan to develop a prototype during the first quarter and progressively refine it. Our goal is to deliver a practical and beneficial product for any consumer seeking a Followbot to carry their belongings or allow the Followbot to go to designated places.

**2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies**<br>


The successful completion of this project hinges on several factors. A significant challenge could arise from changes in the hardware and software resources required for the FollowBotsâ€™s optimal functionality. However, these potential issues are secondary to the primary challenge of maintaining the productâ€™s price under $500. This price point will be a constant consideration throughout the development of our product, but our determination and strategic planning aim to achieve or come close to this goal.

Potential changes in hardware and software could cause temporary delays in the productâ€™s development. The procurement of necessary materials for the hardware aspect of the project could affect our timeline. Similarly, on the software side, the development of the website, app, and machine learning models may encounter delays due to software requirements, errors, and bugs. However, based on our past experiences, we are confident in our teamâ€™s ability to address these issues promptly and meet our project deadline.

We plan to use reliable hardware that has proven effective in both major manufacturing environments and hobbyist builds. For the software, we will develop an API to establish a connection between the Followbot and the website/mobile app. This will allow users to visually monitor the FollowBotâ€™s activities, battery life, and control the device based on user input. We will also develop software that will allow mapping capabilities for the Followbot to travel to specific locations, as well as improving or using machine learning models in order for it to identify obstacles or the user that is following.

*Mobile app that interfaces with the Followbot itself*

**Homepage (Large Screen):**

The homepage will prominently feature the product logo in the top left corner. The productâ€™s name and image will be centrally displayed, serving as the focal point of the webpage. Navigation tabs at the top will provide easy access to specific product information that users are likely to seek. A summary positioned near the bottom, just below the FollowBotâ€™s image, will succinctly convey the productâ€™s primary function and its global applicability to all consumers.

The websiteâ€™s design will reflect the productâ€™s branding, incorporating elements such as the logo, color scheme, and visual identity. Specific elements will highlight our robotic product. The layout will be optimized for a cohesive and visually appealing user experience across various device screen sizes.

A section of the website will consist of discussion pages that will provide guides and support that will be essential for helping those who have questions or are in need of assistance with the Followbot they have on hand.

The webpage on hand will have some form of minor interaction with the Followbot. The interaction will be a form of movemental patterns. We plan on adding 2 specific interactions.

1. Moving in a circle while avoiding obstacles
2. Allowing the user to control the FollowBots movement

The user will also be allowed to sign into his account when on the website, and will be able to see their purchases as well as their discussions that they have been in or created. They will as well be notified for future updates about the product in general.

**Mobile App:**

The mobile app, available for free on all major mobile app stores (including Apple and Android), will provide users with vital information about the Followbot. Upon opening the app, users will be greeted with an iconic image of an animated Followbot, followed by an authentication screen.

If the user does not currently have an account, they will need to create one and input their FollowBotâ€™s authentication key. (Every Followbot has a unique key that is different from another). Once they complete the authentication, the mobile app will present them with a 3D model of the Followbot they currently have on hand.

The top right corner will display a battery life indicator, while the top left corner will show the FollowBotâ€™s internal temperature. Positioned centrally at the bottom, just below the 3D model, an indicator will display the FollowBotâ€™s current carrying capacity, informing users of the weight the Followbot is presently carrying. Keep noted that this is all real time data.

The mobile app will also be able to send the user notifications based on whether the health of the Followbot is stable, if the Followbot is able to track the user, or if certain components of the Followbot are outdated and in need of repair.

The mobile app will consist of a mapping feature where you will be able to map your FollowBot to a specific location or direct it back to your location if it's at another place.

Another notable feature that will be implemented through the app is the ability to control the Followbot. This will be meant for correcting it's position towards the user, playing with the Followbot, or just for testing purposes.

**3.2 Functional Requirements**<br>
* Mapping mechanics for the Followbot to go to specific locations around Bellevue College.
* Computer vision mechanics and learning models in order for the Followbot to identify user when following.
* The functional requirements for this project includes a Followbot that will follow the user while avoiding obstacles and allow the user to place their belongings within it. 
* At the same time the user will be able to control certain mechanics of the Followbot within the mobile app. 
* The mobile app needs to send notifications to the user about the FollowBots needs, as well as possible issues.

* Store the data that is currently being taken as historical data to be used as a way to understand and learn how to incorporate a form of machine learning for the Followbot. This will give us better ways to understand battery power, battery control, as well as ways in enhancing the autonomous movement of the FollowBots behavior.

* And as a consumer that wishes to purchase the product, they will be able to visit the website that contains information about our product. And purchase our product from the site. <br>
