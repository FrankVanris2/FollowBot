**In Reality:**<br>
This robot is versatile and can be used by any individual, regardless of their current activity. Whether it's for work-related tasks, family outings, or simply to carry personal belongings, this robot is designed to meet the individual's needs. <br><br>

**2.3 Design and Implementation Constraints**<br>

The construction of the robot presents a significant challenge, given the intricate engineering required to create a device capable of carrying and autonomously following a user. The hardware components and their assembly will demand meticulous attention and precision.

On the software side, we are currently utilizing a newer version of ROS2, specifically the Jazzy version, which is compatible with Raspberry Pi model 5, the newest one. This will allow us to use complex and newly added packages which will then improve the development for our robot and the software that will be used with the robot.

In terms of project success, our primary focus will be on systematic organization and incremental prototyping. We plan to develop a prototype during the first quarter and progressively refine it. Our goal is to deliver a practical and beneficial product for any consumer seeking a robot to carry their belongings.

**2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies**<br>


The successful completion of this project hinges on several factors. A significant challenge could arise from changes in the hardware and software resources required for the robotâ€™s optimal functionality. However, these potential issues are secondary to the primary challenge of maintaining the productâ€™s price under $500. This price point will be a constant consideration throughout the development of our product, but our determination and strategic planning aim to achieve or come close to this goal.

Potential changes in hardware and software could cause temporary delays in the productâ€™s development. The procurement of necessary materials for the hardware aspect of the project could affect our timeline. Similarly, on the software side, the development of the website and app may encounter delays due to software requirements, errors, and bugs. However, based on our past experiences, we are confident in our teamâ€™s ability to address these issues promptly and meet our project deadline.

We plan to use reliable hardware that has proven effective in both major manufacturing environments and hobbyist builds. For the software, we will develop an API to establish a connection between the robot and the website/mobile app. This will allow users to visually monitor the robotâ€™s activities, battery life, and control the device based on user input.

*Mobile app that interfaces with the robot itself*

**Homepage (Large Screen):**

The homepage will prominently feature the product logo in the top left corner. The productâ€™s name and image will be centrally displayed, serving as the focal point of the webpage. Navigation tabs at the top will provide easy access to specific product information that users are likely to seek. A summary positioned near the bottom, just below the robotâ€™s image, will succinctly convey the productâ€™s primary function and its global applicability to all consumers.

The websiteâ€™s design will reflect the productâ€™s branding, incorporating elements such as the logo, color scheme, and visual identity. Specific elements will highlight our robotic product. The layout will be optimized for a cohesive and visually appealing user experience across various device screen sizes.

A section of the website will consist of discussion pages that will provide guides and support that will be essential for helping those who have questions or are in need of assistance with the robot they have on hand.

The webpage on hand will have some form of minor interaction with the robot. The interaction will be a form of movemental patterns. We plan on adding 2 specific interactions.

1. Moving in a circle while avoiding obstacles
2. Allowing the user to control the robots movement

The user will also be allowed to sign into his account when on the website, and will be able to see their purchases as well as their discussions that they have been in or created. They will as well be notified for future updates about the product in general.

**Mobile App:**

The mobile app, available for free on all major mobile app stores (including Apple and Android), will provide users with vital information about the robot. Upon opening the app, users will be greeted with an iconic image of an animated robot, followed by an authentication screen.

If the user does not currently have an account, they will need to create one and input their robotâ€™s authentication key. (Every robot has a unique key that is different from another). Once they complete the authentication, the mobile app will present them with a 3D model of the robot they currently have on hand.

The top right corner will display a battery life indicator, while the top left corner will show the robotâ€™s internal temperature. Positioned centrally at the bottom, just below the 3D model, an indicator will display the robotâ€™s current carrying capacity, informing users of the weight the robot is presently carrying. Keep noted that this is all real time data.

The mobile app will also be able to send the user notifications based on whether the health of the robot is stable, if the robot is able to track the user, or if certain components of the robot are outdated and in need of repair.

Another notable feature that will be implemented through the app is the ability to control the robot. This will be meant for correcting it's position towards the user, playing with the robot, or just for testing purposes.

**3.2 Functional Requirements**<br>
* The functional requirements for this project includes a robot that will follow the user while avoiding obstacles and allow the user to place their belongings within it. 
* At the same time the user will be able to control certain mechanics of the robot within the mobile app. 
* The mobile app needs to send notifications to the user about the robots needs, as well as possible issues.

* Store the data that is currently being taken as historical data to be used as a way to understand and learn how to incorporate a form of machine learning for the robot. This will give us better ways to understand battery power, battery control, as well as ways in enhancing the autonomous movement of the robots behavior.

* And as a consumer that wishes to purchase the product, they will be able to visit the website that contains information about our product. And purchase our product from the site. <br>
